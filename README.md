# BGGN213

This repositry contains files from the Foundations of Bioinformatics course, a required class for my first year at UCSD.

The first few classes were online, and so did not have hands on sessions, starting week 5 different projects were completed each week.

**Week 4**

[Week 4](https://github.com/mcmkuijpers/BGGN213/blob/main/Week.04/Week4.Lab.Kuijpers_Mirte.pdf) consisted of basic R skills, requiring us to learn basic R and make a simple graph.

**Week 5**

In [class 4](https://github.com/mcmkuijpers/BGGN213/blob/main/Week.05/class05_Mirte.Kuijpers.pdf) we explored data visualization.

In [class 5](https://github.com/mcmkuijpers/BGGN213/blob/main/Week.05/Mirte_Kuijpers_Week05.Friday.Homework.pdf) we learned to write functions.


**Week 6**

In [class 7](https://github.com/mcmkuijpers/BGGN213/blob/main/Week.06/Class.07.Mirte.Kuijpers.pdf) we began to discover machine learning.

We also completed an [unsupervised learning mini-project](https://github.com/mcmkuijpers/BGGN213/blob/main/Week.06/Week.06.Friday.Assignment.pdf).

**Week 7**

[Class 9](https://github.com/mcmkuijpers/BGGN213/blob/main/Week.07/Class.09.Mirte.Kuijpers.pdf) concerned PDB, creating protein structure illustrations and multiple sequence alignment of protein sequences.

[Class 10](https://github.com/mcmkuijpers/BGGN213/blob/main/Week.07/Class.10.Mirte.Kuijpers.R.Script.pdf) focused on SNP data and [genome informatics](https://github.com/mcmkuijpers/BGGN213/blob/main/Week.07/Class.10.Mirte.Kuijpers.pdf).

**Week 8**

[Class 11](https://github.com/mcmkuijpers/BGGN213/blob/main/Week.08/Class.11/Class.11_Mirte_Kuijpers.pdf) taught differential sequence analysis using data from a study on Asthma.

[Class 12](https://github.com/mcmkuijpers/BGGN213/blob/main/Week.08/Class.12/Class.12_Mirte_Kuijpers.pdf) was a RNA-seq data analysis mini-project.

**Week 9**

[Class 13](https://github.com/mcmkuijpers/BGGN213/blob/main/Week.09/Class.13/Class.13_Mirte_Kuijpers.pdf) concerned the command line and doing computationally heavy blast searches through the terminal rather than the NCBI server/website.

[Class 14](https://github.com/mcmkuijpers/BGGN213/blob/main/Week.09/Class.14/Class.14_Mirte_Kuijpers.pdf) brought together various previously learned skills to analyse vaccine uptake in California and the San Diego county.

**Week 10**

[Class 15](https://github.com/mcmkuijpers/BGGN213/blob/main/Class.15/Class.15_Mirte_Kuijpers.pdf) was a mini project using data on pertussis vaccination and the CMI-PB database.

Class 16 concerned making this repositry.
